Forked from https://gist.github.com/stevesouders/5952488

Reason I forked it is because JSDelivr doesn't work with Gists. 

Original description on gist (with an updated URL):

> ActiveTable is a bookmarklet that makes any table sortable. It also allows you to remove columns, and it remembers the removed columns for next time. Use alt+click to UNhide all columns (and clear memory). To use it, create a bookmark called "ActiveTable" that has this URL: 
>
>`javascript:(function(){ var jselem=document.createElement('SCRIPT'); jselem.type='text/javascript'; jselem.src='https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/rubenvarela/sorttable@master/activetable.js'; document.getElementsByTagName('head')[0].appendChild(jselem); })();`
